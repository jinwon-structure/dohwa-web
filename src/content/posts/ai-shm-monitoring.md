## Introduction

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is undergoing a revolution with the advent of Artificial Intelligence. Traditional methods often rely on manual inspection or threshold-based sensors.

## The AI Approach

By utilizing deep learning algorithms, we can detect anomalies in vibration data that would be impossible for human analysts to spot in real-time.

### Key Benefits
- **Real-time detection**: Instant alerts for structural anomalies.
- **Predictive maintenance**: Forecasting potential failures before they occur.
- **Cost reduction**: Minimizing the need for physical inspections.
